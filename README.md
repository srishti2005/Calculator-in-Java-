# Calculator in Java
This is a program that performs all calculator operations such as addition , Subtraction , Multiplication , division , along with fibonacci series calculation and sum average of arrays.
# Calculator and Utility Program

This Java-based program implements a simple calculator and various utility functions including Fibonacci sequence generation, array sum and average calculation, and basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The division operation has been designed to return floating-point results (i.e., `double`).

## Features
- **Basic Calculator:** Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (with floating-point precision).
- **Fibonacci Sequence Generator:** Generate a Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number of terms.
- **Array Operations:** Calculate the sum and average of elements in an array.
- **Input Validation:** Handles invalid inputs and ensures users provide valid integer values.

## Requirements
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):**

## Project Structure
The project is organized into three main classes:

1. **`Calculator.java`:** Contains the logic for arithmetic operations, Fibonacci sequence generation, and array sum/average calculation.
2. **`Main.java`:** The entry point of the program, which interacts with the user and calls the appropriate methods based on the user's choices.
3. **`UserInput.java`:** Handles user input and validation for the calculator, Fibonacci sequence, and array operations.
